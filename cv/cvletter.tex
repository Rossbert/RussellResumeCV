My name is Sergio Rosales, and I am writing to express my interest for
the position of Calculations Engineer at SII Germany. My skills are
well suited for the application and moreover, you will see that my
professional background matches precisely what you are looking for.

Currently, I am completing my master thesis in the field of Space
Engineering. Throughout my studies, I have gained experience in Finite
Element analysis (FEM) and have worked using Ansys for both structural
and thermal design. While  I have not yet applied these skills in the
working field, I am highly motivated to do so and committed to further
developing my expertise. Additionally, my strong programming skills in
Python and other languages allow me to contribute to diverse
computational and simulation tasks and are advantageous for developing
engineering applications.

I also gained experience in the Thermal Department in ArianeGroup,
first as a part-time student employee and then as a master thesis
researcher. During this time, I learned the importance of applying my
knowledge in real life applications. Notwithstanding, I gathered
important insight in the processes that take place in the aerospace
industry. As a result, I had the opportunity of being part of on-the
field applications, which strengthened my understanding of the
studies.

I strongly identify with SII Germany's commitment to efficiency,
professionalism, and ethical standards. I am eager to develop my
leadership skills, improve my teamwork capabilities, expand my
knowledge of synergy work, and most importantly, apply my agile
traits.

In conclusion, my goal is to learn and offer all my abilities and
experience in return. I am thankful in advance for considering me for
this opportunity and I expect to make this experience the most
rewarding not only for myself but for the company as well.\hfill\break
With utter enthusiasm I look forward to your reply.
