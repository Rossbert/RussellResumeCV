My name is Sergio Rosales, and I am writing to express my interest for
the position of Avionics Architect at OHB SE. With my background in
Space Engineering, hands-on experience in electronics design, and
active participation in aerospace projects, I am confident that my
skills are well suited for the position.

Currently, I am completing my master thesis in the field of Space
Engineering. Although my academic background is not primarily in
electronics, my experience in R\&D, particularly at IMEMED, has
allowed me to develop critical skills in electronics design. During my
time there, I led the electronics design team, in the development of
Bolivia's first ICU ventilator and portable X-ray machine, projects
that involved solving complex technical challenges in real-world
applications.

In addition, as a member of the Avionics team in the student
initiative ASTRA e.V., I contributed to the design of a rocket that
aims to reach the Kármán line. This experience gave me valuable
insight into avionics systems, interface management, and system-level
trade-offs. My recent involvement in the thermal engineering team at
ArianeGroup further deepened my understanding of aerospace development
processes and reinforced my ability to work in multidisciplinary
teams.

Although, I have not yet participated full lifecycle of a project in
the aerospace industry, I am highly motivated to expand my expertise
in this area. I am highly motivated to continuously develop my
expertise.

I share OHB SE's commitment to innovation, efficiency, and technical
excellence. This makes me eager to the opportunity of growing my
leadership skills, improving my teamwork capabilities, expanding my
knowledge of synergy work, and most importantly, applying my agile
traits.

In conclusion, my goal is to learn and offer all my abilities and
experience in return. I am thankful in advance for considering me for
this opportunity.\hfill\break
With utter enthusiasm I look forward to your reply.
