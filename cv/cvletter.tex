My name is Sergio Rosales, and as an enrolled student of the master of
Space Engineering at the University of Bremen, I am writing to express
my interest for the position of a master thesis in your company. You
will find soon that my skills are well suited for the application and
moreover, you will see that my professional background matches
precisely what you are looking for.

For the past months, I've had the privilege of working a part-time
student job in the Thermal Department in ArianeGroup. During this
time, I learned the importance of applying my knowledge in real life
applications. Notwithstanding, I gathered important insight in the
processes that take place in the aerospace industry. As a result, I
had the opportunity of being part of on-the field applications, which
strengthened my understanding of the studies.

I am particularly impressed with the work policy, the efficiency and
the commitment to ethics in the workplace. Continuing the master
thesis in this department will allow me to further develop these
skills. Throughout the duration of the master thesis, I commit to do
full research and complete the intended work with rigorous dedication.
I am eager to develop my leadership skills, improve my teamwork
capabilities, expand my knowledge of synergy work, and most
importantly, apply my agile traits.

In conclusion, my goal in the company is to learn everything that I
can and offer all my abilities and experience in return. I am thankful
in advance for considering me for this opportunity and I expect to
make this experience the most rewarding not only for myself but for
the company as well.\hfill\break
With utter enthusiasm I look forward to your reply.
