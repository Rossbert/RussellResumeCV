My name is Sergio Rosales, and I am writing to express my interest for
the position of \textit{Lead Avionics Engineer}. With my background in
Space Engineering, hands-on experience in R\&D, and involvement in
diverse software development projects, I am confident that my skills
are well suited for the position.

For starters my degree's master project involved the development of
level C and C++ frameworks for Convolutional Neural Networks,
experience that sharpened my programming skills. In addition to that,
during my position in IMEMED, I led the electronics design team,
working in embedded systems development for Bolivia's first ICU
ventilator and portable X-ray machine, projects that involved solving
complex technical challenges in real-world applications.

Additionally, as a member of the avionics team in the student
initiative ASTRA e.V., I contributed to the design of a rocket that
aims to reach the Kármán line. This experience gave me valuable
insight into avionics systems, power management, and system-level
trade-offs. My recent involvement in the thermal engineering team at
ArianeGroup further deepened my understanding of aerospace design
processes and reinforced my ability to work in multidisciplinary
teams.

I share POLARIS Raumflugzeuge GmbH's commitment to innovation,
efficiency, and technical excellence. This makes me eager to seize the
opportunity of growing my leadership skills, improving my teamwork
capabilities, expanding my professional knowledge, and most
importantly, applying my agile traits.

In conclusion, I'm ready to start as a leader of the avionics team in
the company bringing my technical and leadership skills. I appreciate
your consideration and welcome the opportunity to discuss the
position.\hfill\break
I look forward to your reply.
