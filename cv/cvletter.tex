My name is Sergio Rosales, and I am writing to express my interest for
the position of \textit{Softwareentwickler- KI -Entwicklung at
Rheinmetall}. With my background in Space Engineering, hands-on
experience in R\&D, and experience in diverse software development
projects, I am confident that my skills are well suited for the
position.

Currently, I am completing my master thesis in the field of Space
Engineering. My degree's master involved the development of level C
and C++ frameworks for Convolutional Neural Networks. In addition to
that, during my position in IMEMED, I led the electronics design team,
working in embedded development for Bolivia's first ICU ventilator and
portable X-ray machine, projects that involved solving complex
technical challenges in real-world applications.

In addition, as a member of the Avionics team in the student
initiative ASTRA e.V., I contributed to the design of a rocket that
aims to reach the Kármán line. This experience gave me valuable
insight into avionics systems, interface management, and system-level
trade-offs. My recent involvement in the thermal engineering team at
ArianeGroup further deepened my understanding of aerospace development
processes and reinforced my ability to work in multidisciplinary
teams.

I share Rheinmetall's commitment to innovation, efficiency, and
technical excellence. This makes me eager to the opportunity of
growing my leadership skills, improving my teamwork capabilities,
expanding my professional knowledge, and most importantly, applying
my agile traits.

In conclusion, my goal is to learn and offer all my abilities and
experience in return. I am thankful in advance for considering me for
this opportunity.\hfill\break
With utter enthusiasm I look forward to your reply.
